    <p>As a highly successful realtor, broker, credit repair expert, and former law enforcement officer, Cornelius Jackson uses his wealth of skills and experience to run his company, CLJ Enterprise Inc.</p>
    <p>Cornelius has worked in real estate for fifteen years and started his company, CLJ Realty Group in Orange County, California, just over five years ago. He created his business with the original intent to assist asset managers with selling REO properties (property that the lender has repossessed for non-payment of the mortgage loan) – but he shifted his focus and explains, “While going through the process, I saw a lot of people lose their house, so I shifted gears and started helping people in pre-foreclosure by using my unique marketing techniques to help them sell.” So, in addition to selling these properties, he helps people that may be losing their homes.</p>
    <p>Cornelius also expanded his focus to assist people with bad credit and help them rebuild, so they can become homeowners. Two years ago, he formed CLJ Financial, a financial literacy and credit restoration organization. There, he coaches and mentors’ people while helping them get ready to close on their first home. Due to the overwhelming demand for his credit services. He merged with another company to Form Credit Dominators and is the current CEO and Co-Founder of the company. He adds that he truly cares about people and wants to see them do well, so he offers the guidance that they need to be financially successful and independent. CLJ Financial also offers businesspeople a platform to establish and build business credit for their corporation. As a retired law enforcement officer, Cornelius truly understands his clients’ needs, especially from a security perspective. This experience translates into helping his clients make the right decisions and help themselves.</p>
